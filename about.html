					<p>Oi! My name is Izabella Timmons.
					<br>I’m a User Experience Designer, born and raised in Brazil, now living in Austin, TX.</p>
					<p>For the first seven years of my career, I worked as an electrician in a steel mill. During this time my primary responsibilities included maintenance and implementation of large overhead cranes used to move vats of molten steel. I enjoyed the challenge and new technologies and proving my value in a gritty masculine environment.</p>
					<p>Next, I transitioned to a role in customer service where I was responsible for ensuring positive customer experiences with a globally recognized luxury brand assisting their clients to fully understand products - as well as responding to customers who had not had a great product experience.</p>
					<p>Both experiences helped me gain skills in communication, teamwork, problem-solving, quick learning, time management, and process improvement. I've learned that to solve a problem it is crucial to understand the problem statement and underlying consumer need.</p>
					<p>While these previous roles were challenging my passion since childhood has been art and design which is why I have decided to make a career change to align my career with doing something I love.</p>
					<p>Bloc.io - an online Design bootcamp apprenticeship has given me the opportunity to complete my UX studies and gain practical experience working on real-world projects. I am passionate about solving problems through design with simple and beautiful solutions.</p>
					<p>When I’m not thinking about (or actually doing) design, I love traveling, spending time with friends, going to concerts or for a walk in the park.</p>
